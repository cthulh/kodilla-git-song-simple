            <p>If you like to gamble, I tell you I'm your man,
              You win some, lose some, all the same to me,
              The pleasure is to play, makes no difference what you say,
              I don't share your greed, the only card I need is
              The Ace of Spades x2</p>
              <p>Playing for the high one, dancing with the devil,
              Going with the flow, it's all the same to me,
              Seven or Eleven, snake eyes watching you,
              Double up or quit,double stake or split,
              The Ace of Spades x2</p>
              <p>You know I'm born to lose,and gambling's for fools,
              But that's the way I like it baby,
              I don't wanna live forever,
              And don't forget the joker!</p>
              <p>Pushing up the ante, I know you've got to see me,
              Read'em and weep, the dead man's hand again,
              I see it in your eyes, take one look and die,
              The only thing you see, you know it's gonna be,
              The Ace of Spades x2</p>
